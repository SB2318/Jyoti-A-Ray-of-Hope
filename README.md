# Community Learning & Activity Management System

## First look. First launch. Coming to life at SRISTI 2026

# Story:

This is one incomplete task of mine at **JGEC**,
a journey that began during survey.

Back then, I shared the idea with my batchmates,
and their encouragement gave me the confidence to move forward ‚Äî
special thanks to **Dibeyendu, Soumavo, and Rose**
for their support in the very beginning.

Yes, everything takes time, but just like **UltimateHealth**,
I believe this journey too will reach its completion. or, at the very least, its structure will serve as a foundation for the future.

## Overview

This will be a **non-profit mobile and backend platform** developed to support a JGEC student-led initiative that provides **free education** and **extra-curricular activities** for children, especially in rural and under-served areas.

The system will help organizers:
- Manage students and activities
- Keep track of attendance and participation
- Conduct rural area surveys to identify children lacking access to education
- Organize and schedule classes, workshops, and events

## Objectives
- Provide **free tuition classes** for school subjects.
- Promote **extra-curricular activities** like dancing, singing, drawing, and cultural programs.
